  JSONb is a library for parsing JSON from lazy ByteStrings. It assumes the
  input is UTF-8.


                                                                    Test Suite
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We test the library by:

   .  Pulling down large amounts of JSON from various web service providers.

   .  Parsing and unparsing the JSON with our parser.

   .  Feeding the original JSON along with our unparsed variety to the
      json.org parser.

   .  Testing that our parsed-unparsed JSON parses to the same JavaScript
      values as the original JSON from the point of view of the json.org
      parser.
